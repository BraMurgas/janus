Introduction
============

Janus is a Python library dedicated to the discretization of the Lippmann--Schwinger equation with periodic boundary conditions. The matrix of the resulting linear system is the sum of a block-diagonal matrix and a block-circulant matrix. Following the ideas initially introduced by Moulinec and Suquet [MS98]_ matrix-vector products can then be computed efficiently by means of the `Fast Fourier Transform <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform>`_. A matrix-free strategy is then adopted to solve the linear system iteratively, e.g. (non-exhaustive list)

- fixed-point iterations [MS98]_,
- accelerated schemes [EM99]_,
- augmented Lagrangians [MMS01]_,
- Krylov subspace linear sovers [BD10]_,
- polarization-based schemes [MB12]_,

see also [MS14]_ for a comparison of some of these iterative schemes.

The library provides tools to define the linear operator associated to the discretized Lippmann--Schwinger equation, and to compute the necessary matrix-vector products. Third-party iterative linear solvers (`Scipy <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.15.1/reference/sparse.linalg.html#solving-linear-problems>`_, `petsc4py <https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc4py>`_) can then be invoked to compute the solution.

The library is designed with performance in mind. It is fully parallelized (using MPI and `mpi4py <https://bitbucket.org/mpi4py/mpi4py>`_), and the critical parts of the code are written in `Cython <http://cython.org/>`_.

History of major changes
========================

2015-02-23 — Reconciliation of the APIs of FFT objects and operators
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The following attributes of FFT objects were renamed (incompatible changes)

- ``rshape`` → ``ishape``: the shape of the *local* input array,
- ``cshape`` → ``oshape``: the shape of the *local* output array,
- ``shape`` → ``global_ishape``: the shape of the *global* input array.

Besides, the following attribute was added

- ``global_oshape``: the shape of the *global* output array.
